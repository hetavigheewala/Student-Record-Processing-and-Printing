# Student-Record-Processing-and-Printing

This C++ code explores the concept of structures. It defines two different structures, `oneScore_t` and `student_t`, which hold information about scores and student records respectively. The program demonstrates various operations involving structures:

1. Populating and printing individual `oneScore_t` structures.
2. Populating and printing individual `student_t` structures, including an array of scores.
3. Using a function to create and return a populated `student_t` structure.
4. Printing an array of `student_t` structures along with their scores.
5. Reading student data from a comma-delimited file and populating an array of `student_t` structures.

The code uses these structures to manage and display data about students and their scores, showcasing the utility of structures for organizing and manipulating related data fields.
